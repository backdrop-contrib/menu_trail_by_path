Menu Trail by Path
==================

Menu Trail by Path allows you to set the active-trail on menu items according to
the current URL.

For example, if you are at yoursite.com/blog/category1/article1 then menu items
with these paths will get the active-trail class on them and expand accordingly:

- blog
- blog/category1
- blog/category1/article1

This is particularly useful if you want a lot of nodes to appear as children of
certain nodes/taxonomy terms/views/referenced nodes/etc., but do not want to add
them all to the menu.
